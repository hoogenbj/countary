# Countary
An opinionated Budgeting program.  
Binaries will be available soon, but if you are any kind of programmer you should be
able to clone this repo, do a build, and run Countary yourself. All you need is
Java (11 or later) and Gradle (7.6 or later).  
The documentation is still a work in progress, but check back
often: [Documentation](https://hoogenbj.github.io/countary/).  
Cheers!
