# Accounts
Countary can keep track of transactions for an unlimited number of bank accounts. Accounts

button (click on the image to make it bigger):

Type the information in the fields on the dialog and click on **OK** to create an account.
The new account will be added to the combobox in the top-left area of the 
`Transactions worksheet` where it can be selected.

There is also an `Accounts worksheet` that can be accessed from the `Show` menu:
