# Budgets
Countary supports three kinds of budgets: `Monthly`, `Annual` and `Ad hoc`. Having 
a `monthly` budget is perhaps not unusual. Most self-help literature that mention budgeting
refers to having a budget for your monthly income and expenses. I have yet to come 
across any that suggest budgeting for `annual` expenses - let alone `ad hoc` expenses!
And yet, I am convinced you need all three kinds if you are going to be successful in
your endeavour.

Once you have your annual and monthly budget you don't need to start over for a new
month or year. You can simply `Clone` a budget and add new items or remove items that
are no longer relevant.

## Annual budgets
There are certain kinds of expenses that only happen once or perhaps a few times a year.
If you do not budget for those, they will come as a shock.
It can be a tremendous confidence boost to plan for and have the money available for
those less frequent expenses when they come around!

For example, take a look at the annual budget in the Demo database (click to make it bigger):  
[![Annual budget](images/demo_annual_budget.png)](images/demo_annual_budget.png)

You probably don't buy clothing every month, or, if you do, perhaps for different members
of your family. Better to budget for it on an annual basis. Similarly, you don't
service your car every month. Once you put these items in a budget with what you 
estimate you will need to spend, you can easily calculate what you need to put away
every month.

Just select all the items (except for deposits) and click on the ![calculator](images/calculate.png)
icon. You'll see a dialog popup with the results of the most common calculations (click to make it bigger):  
[![calculate monthly deposit](images/calculate_monthly_deposit.png)](images/calculate_monthly_deposit.png)

The result you are looking for is the `Sum / 12` one. This tells you how much you must
put away every month to make sure you have the money available when you need it. It won't
be perfect. It will all depend on your cash flow, but you should be able to `borrow` from
other items because you won't need to spend everything at once. Just make sure to consistenly 
put the money aside every month and your cash flow will catch up.

Have a look at the other budgets in the Demo database to get a feel for things.

So how do you allocate funds to the different budgets? Here's an example from the 
Demo database (click to make it bigger):  
[![alloc to many](images/allocate_to_many_budgets.png)](images/allocate_to_many_budgets.png)

The screen may seem a little busy at first. Take some time to study it. You will notice
that the check box `Show completed` is ticked. That is how you can see the transactions
that have already been allocated, because transactions that are fully allocated normally
disappear from view.

The next thing to notice is that the transaction from `Feb 25, 2023` is selected. That
is a salary deposit. The smaller window in the bottom centre part of the image shows
how the deposit amount is divided between five different budgets. So this is how money
is divided among the different budgets.

The secret to making all of this work is that **absolutely every** transaction in your bank account
needs to end up somewhere in one or more budgets. Otherwise, your account will leak money
and eventually it will become a hemorrhage, and you will lose complete control.

If you really don't have a place for a transaction at least allocate it to an item 
called `unplanned` in your monthly budget, so you can see the effect. This will
stop you from spending money you don't have.

## Ad hoc budgets
You will use an `Ad hoc` budget for expenses that come around once in a lifetime, or
maybe only every couple of years. Such as buying a new motorcycle helmet (those should
be replaced every 5 years!) or maybe a new washing machine. Or perhaps you need to save
for your child's university education. Set up the budget and estimate how many months
you have before you need to start spending the money. Divide that into the total and you
will have the amount you need to put away every month to save for it.

## Monthly budgets
Monthly budgets are covered last not because they are less important, but perhaps they
are emphasised too much.

Let's look at the transactions worksheet as it looks like when you first open the 
demo database. (If you don't know yet how to open the demo database go [here](databases.markdown)).  
Click on the image to make it bigger:
[![demo transactions](images/transactions_worksheet.png)](images/transactions_worksheet.png)
Here you can see a number of transactions that have yet to be allocated. Transactions
can come from two sources: bank statements or manual entry. It would take too much
time and effort to add transactions by hand, so importing transactions from a bank
statement is the way to go. To learn about importing bank statements, go 
[here](bank_statements.md).

The objective now is to make all transactions disappear by allocating them to the
different budgets. But first, you should know where the transactions come from when
you do your own budgeting. The best way to do that is to keep the receipts for
everything that you buy. Write a little note on each receipt to make sure that you 
remember what it was for. That way you'll know for sure what item to allocate the
transaction to.

The demo database makes it easy for you to see how it can be done. Select the `March 2023`
budget and click on some items. Here you can see what happens when you click on the 
`Groceries` item (Click on the image to make it bigger):
[![groceries](images/demo_groceries_selected.png)](images/demo_groceries_selected.png)
It shows that multiple transactions were allocated to the `Groceries` item. If you 
click on the `Show completed` checkbox in the top left area of the window, you get
to see the transactions that have already been allocated. They are highlighted in green.
You can click on any of those to see which item they were allocated to. Here you can
see which item the `DISC PREM` for April 1st is allocated to (Click on the imate to make it bigger):

Also, recall that a transaction can be split over multiple budgets, as the salary example
earlier shows.
