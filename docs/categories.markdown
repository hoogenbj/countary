# Categories
Before we can create `budgets`, we need `items` to assign to them and `categories` help
to organise items. Initially it may be enough to simply have `Income` and `Expense` categories,
but as you grow more comfortable with the concepts you can always go back and create
more categories and modify existing ones.

Here's what the Categories worksheet for the Demo database looks like (click to make it 
bigger):

Categories are organised in a hierarchy or tree-type structure. As with budgets and
items, you can have three kinds of categories `Monthly`, `Annual` or `Ad hoc`. To grow
your structure of categories, select a category and either click `Add Sibling` or
`Add Child` depending on whether you want to add a category on the same level or one 
level below. You can also change the color of a category. A category may also be
deleted if it has not yet been assigned to an item.

Click one of the `Monthly`, `Annual` or `Ad hoc` radio buttons to view the categories
for those kinds of budgets.

Once you are ready with the `categories` you want, you can go ahead and create the `items`
for your `budgets`. [Click here](images/items_worksheet.png) to learn about `Items`.

You can come back to the Categories worksheet at any time to create more categories
or modify existing ones.

Just click on the `Rename` button to rename category. Make sure the category you want
to rename is selected first.
