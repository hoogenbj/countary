# Getting Started
There are two ways to run Countary - download a binary from the latest release,
or build and run from the source code. Downloading and using a binary is the easiest. Note that
doing either signifies acceptance of the terms of the 
[license](https://github.com/hoogenbj/countary/blob/main/LICENSE).
## From the source code
You will need version 19+ of the JDK installed, as well as at least v7.6 of Gradle.
1. Clone the [repo](https://hoogenbj.github.io/countary).
2. Run `gradle wrapper` in the root of the project.
3. Run `./gradlew run`.

## From a binary
Go to the [repo](https://hoogenbj.github.io/countary) and click on the latest release.
Download a suitable release (Windows or Mac). Sorry, no Linux packages yet.
