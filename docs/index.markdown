# Welcome to the documentation for Countary!
Countary is a budgeting program. You can create multiple budgets spanning
multiple bank accounts and keep everything up-to-date with statement imports.
It currently supports .csv imports from RMB Private Bank 
(and probably FNB as well, since RMB Private Bank piggy-backs on FNB's systems)
and Bank Zero. These are banks in South Africa - but do not despair!    
It also supports OFX for importing of statements. This means that Countary
likely can be used to import statements from any bank in the world that provides
OFX format exports!  
Don't know what OFX format is? If you are/were a Microsoft Money or Quicken/Quickbooks
user, then you might've been using OFX already - if you were importing 
transactions from your bank.
