# Welcome to the documentation for Countary!
Countary is a budgeting program. You can create multiple budgets spanning
multiple bank accounts and keep everything up-to-date with statement imports.
It currently supports .csv imports from RMB Private Bank 
(and probably FNB as well, since RMB Private Bank piggy-backs on FNB's systems),
Bank Zero, and Capitec. These are banks in South Africa - but do not despair!    
It also supports OFX (v1.x and v2.x) for importing of statements. This means that Countary
likely can be used to import statements from any bank in the world that provides
OFX format exports!  
Don't know what OFX format is? If you are/were a Microsoft Money or Quicken/Quickbooks
user, then you might've been using OFX already - if you were importing 
transactions from your bank.
## System requirements
# Apple
Any macOS version that supports running the Java 19+ SDK and JafaFX 19+. Display size should be at 
least 1080p. (Tested on macOS Big Sur v11.7.6 )
# Windows
Any Windows version that supports running the Java 19+ SDK and JafaFX 19+. Display size 
should be at least 1080p. Watch out for modes that increase Font size. It will cause 
Countary's window to no longer fit on the display. (Tested on Windows Home 10 and Pro 11)
# Linux
Untested. Should run though - as long as Java 19+ and JavaFX 19+ is supported. Display size should
be at least 1080p. You will have to build your own binary for now...
