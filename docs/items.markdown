# Items
The `Items` worksheet for the Demo database looks like this (Click to make it bigger):  
[![Items worksheet](images/items_worksheet.png)](images/items_worksheet.png)

Items go in budgets, so before you can create a budget, you create the items for it.
It takes some practice to get the naming just right - or at least right for you. You can delete
an item that has not been added to a budget yet by clicking on the trashcan icon. If
it has been added to a budget the icon will be greyed-out - which means it is disabled.

Items can be re-used - added to more than one budget. You also get different kinds
of items - `annual`, `monthly` and `ad hoc`. Only `annual` items can be added to `annual`
budgets, for instance. You can have items with the same name as long as they are
different in kind. You can also name `categories` and `items` the same - it is really
up to you.

You should already have categories that you can assign to your items. If you don't,
[click here](categories.markdown) to find out more about categories first.

To create a new `Item`, click on `Create Item...` and fill in the fields:  
![Create Item](images/create_item.png)

You can also tag your items. Just start typing in the `Tags` column and press enter.
Or if the tag already exists, it will appear in a list of possibilities and you can select 
it:

You can also tag many items at once. Just select the ones you want to tag and click `Tag...`:

When you have the items you want, you can go ahead and create some budgets. 
[Click here](budgets.markdown) to learn more about budgets.

You can always come back to the Items worksheet to create more items. You can also 
modify the names and categories of items - just double-click to change.
