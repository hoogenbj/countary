# Why Countary?
I am pretty sure rich people will tell you that they got rich by being careful
spending money.

It is hard to get rich, but it is much harder to stay rich. `Rich` means something
different for everybody. For you and I it might just mean having the money when we need
it. The best way to ensure that is to plan for it - to budget.

I suspect that people who tried to budget and failed did so because they did not
go far enough. I believe it is not good enough to have a budget for monthly
expenses. Too many things will fall through the cracks. A budget for monthly
expense is a good start. To have a good chance of succeeding at budgeting, you
need budgets for annual expenses and for big ad hoc expenses.

I currently have 20 budgets of which 9 are no longer active. This figure will
continue to grow and grow. Once you've closed off a budget it becomes inactive
but still useful as a record. A budget is closed off once you've completed
a year, or a month, or you've finished buying something that you saved up for.

I think it works for me because I've made budgeting fun. I've been budgeting
for our household expenses for decades now. There are not many things as
satisfying as having the money to spend on something just because you planned for
it!

Over the years I've use budgeting as an excuse to learn new programming languages
and technologies. Countary is the latest incarnation of a program that evolved
over a period of decades. I finally put in the extra effort it takes to put
something out there for people to use.
