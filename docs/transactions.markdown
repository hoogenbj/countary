# Transactions
A transaction describes a movement of money. Money may be deposited in an account,
transferred to another account, or withdrawn from an account.

Where budgets are concerned, a deposit transaction can be split over many budgets,
for example, a salary can be split over the `monthly` budget, the `holiday` budget,
the `emergency` budget and the `annual` budget.

On the other hand, multiple transactions can be assigned to one budget item.
For example, e-toll transactions can be assigned to the `E-Toll` budget item
of the `monthly` budget.

Here's a view of the `Transactions Worksheet` for the Demo database (click on it 
to see a bigger version):

The main objective should always be to add every transaction to items in one or more
budgets. Once a transaction is fully allocated, it is removed from view.

Here's an example of a salary transaction dated `25 Feb, 2023` that was allocated
to several budgets (click to make it bigger):

The green colour signifies allocated transactions and the `Show completed` check box
allows you to view transactions that have already been allocated.

And here's an example of multiple transactions that were allocated to `Groceries` in
the `March 2023` budget (click to make it bigger):

On this view you can also see a number of transactions that have not yet been allocated.
See if you can figure out how to allocate them.
