# Transactions
A transaction describes a movement of money. Money may be deposited in an account,
transferred to another account, or withdrawn from an account.

Where budgets are concerned, a deposit transaction can be split over many budgets,
for example, a salary can be split over the `monthly` budget, the `holiday` budget,
the `emergency` budget and the `annual` budget.

On the other hand, multiple transactions can be assigned to one budget item.
For example, e-toll transactions can be assigned to the `E-Toll` budget item
of the `monthly` budget.

`Countary` will always show the `Transactions Worksheet` first. This initial
view is where most of your time will be spent deciding what to do with each
transaction.

Here's a view of the `Transactions Worksheet` for the Demo database (click on it
