# Troubleshooting
The author and his wife have been the only users of Countary so far.  It is highly likely that other users
will find bugs that he missed. But bugs can be fixed.

In case of an error a dialog will display which should explain what went wrong:

![error dialog](images/error_dialog.png)

If there is a stack trace, there will be a **Copy to clipboard** button which
can be used to copy the stack trace to the clipboard. An [**issue**](https://github.com/hoogenbj/countary/issues) 
detailing the circumstances of the error can be created and should include the stack 
trace if there was one. Feel free to add screenshots to the issue. There is no guarantee 
of support, but the author also uses Countary so it is likely that issues will be addressed.

The repository can be `watched` to get notified of activity - such as a new version being released.
