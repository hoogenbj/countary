In case of an error a dialog will display which should explain what went wrong:

![error dialog](error_dialog.png)

If there is a stack trace, there will be a `Copy to clipboard` button which
can be used to copy the stack trace to the clipboard. An email can be sent to 
[support](mailto:johan@nitingale-it.co.za) detailing the circumstances of the error
and should include the stack trace if there was one. There is no guarantee of
support, but the author also uses Countary so it is likely that issues will be addressed.

The repository can be watched to get notified of activity - such as a new version being released.
