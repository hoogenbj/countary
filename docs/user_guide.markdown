# Using Countary
The first thing you will see once you have Countary running for the first time,
is this:

## Open Database
This is what you will do if you already have a database somewhere on your
machine. Maybe you copied it from your previous computer...

## Open Demo Database
This one you will pick if you want to take a look at the Demo database. A new 
Demo database will be created every time you click here. *Any changes will be 
lost once Countary is closed*. You can play around with it and even use it as 
a basis for your own budgeting - just create a backup of it and restore the 
backup over a new database if you want that.

## Create New Database
This is probably the one you will pick once you've had a look at the Demo
database and are ready to start with your own.

## Nothing
Maybe you want to continue later.

To continue using Countary, you will need to understand the concepts:
